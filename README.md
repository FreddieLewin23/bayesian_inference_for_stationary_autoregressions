Advisor: Dr Sarah Heaps, Associate Professor, Durham University

This project, prodominately done in Python, explores the use of Hidden Markov Models, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PyMC), and Bayesian Inference in the context of sampling from stationary
autoregressions. I want to apply the these sampling techniques to Trading Strategies similar to my previous projects to generate alpha.
